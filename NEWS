version 1.0
-----------
* Since, according to gnu.org, the modified BSD-style license is already 
  GPL compatible, simplified the licensing story by making this BSD-only.

* Fixed off-by-one errors causing incorrect rendering around the now date.

* Replaced the existing yes/no and discussion intensity keys with visually 
  cleaner implementation.


version 0.98
------------
* Updated Bets notification HTML as per latest mockup.

* The default notifier now outputs dates more readably as "July 23, 02004"
  instead of as "02004/07/23".

* Color swatches and a vote discussion intensity image for the key are now
  generated automatically.  This should fix problems viewing the key in
  Internet Explorer.

* Added BSD-style and GPL licenses.

* Added QUESTIONS/FEEDBACK and KNOWN ISSUES sections to README.txt.

* Updated arrow gifs and background images to be transparent.

* Added support for new params: TIMELINE.staticimage, TIMELINE.topframeheight,
  TIMELINE.nowbarcolor, TIMELINE.backgroundstipplecolor, EVENTBAR.nowbarontop,
  and TIMELINE.nowbarwidth.
  
* Fixed up credits and copyright in the scripts.

* Added a <div> for the future section so that the background image always
  extends to the far right of the timeline.

* Added target="_top" to all external links so that they don't open
  inside one of the frames.

* Updated bets and biotech examples to closely match the latest mockups; 
  used biotech style for defaults when possible.

* Updated bets example with more complete data.

* Support interest files without discussion data by failling back to a
  relativePosts (brightness) constant of 0.5.

* Add support for a special eventbar end-date of "?", which causes the 
  eventbar to end at the now date, but renders in strings as "?"
  (without the quotes).

* Add support for a special timeline section end-date of "Ongoing", which 
  can be used to indicate that the future section should end two intervals
  after the now-date.

* Fixed a bug where the last anchor target for automatically generated navcells
  was usually set incorrectly.

* Set the background divider width to TIMELINE.minbarwidth

* Various minor fixes and cleanups: program bugs, credits, copyright notices, 
  and documentation updates.


version 0.97
------------
* Implemented notification display.

* The notifications file now includes a rowID field and stores the
  sent-date in the status field.

* The timeline data file now includes a rowID field.

* Interest file rendering has been implemented.

* All timeline bars are now rendered with merged slicemaker/BarImage
  code.

* sliceMaker.py code was refactored to make it easier to use from
  other python code (ie it no longer requires temporary files for I/O).


version 0.96
------------
* Minor bugfixes from 0.95


version 0.95
------------
* In timeline data files, all lines must now be preceeded with an item number.
  The examples have been updated to reflect this change.  We're going to need
  this item number to correlate each item with corresponding notification data
  and interest bars.

* The Long Bets example has been updated with some real data from the Long
  Bets web site.

* Fixed a bug where the navcell outline did not track the clicked-on navcell.


version 0.94
------------
* The "now" navcells are now generated PNGs which display the now box in
  the correct spot within the navcell.

* Documented installation dependencies

* If no navcells are specified in a param file, a set of navcells is now
  generated automatically.


version 0.93
------------
* Implemented automatic rendering of navbar now cell PNG.  In progress, doesn't
  actually draw the now box in the right place yet.

* Fixed a bug where not all bars were being rendered with the future section 
  colored correctly.

* Fixed bug where pastnowcell was not appearing in the right place relative
  to the background.

* Implemented function overrides; described in detail in README.txt

* Implemented notification capability; described in detail in README.txt

* Implemented distutils-based (i.e the standard python setup.py)
  packaging scheme, and added logic to longview to run either from a
  build directory or from an installation

* Removed generated files from the prototype-html directory


version 0.92
------------
* Created a third python file, the template file, to hold HTML templates, CSS,
  and function overrides.  Added lots of commentary to the CSS data used in
  the example template files.

* Tweaked the invocation of longview.py so that only the params file is 
  given on the command line.  The names of the other files are specified in
  the params file.

* Added make-dist.py for automatic creation of the release tarball.


version 0.91
------------
* 5-digit years now supported and used

* YYYYY/MM format now supported

* Lots of miscellaneous code cleanups

* Popup HTML generation is now generalized, and comes from a template
  in the param file.  As a result, the format of the data file has
  changed slightly.


version 0.9
-----------
* what used to be called the appearance file is now referred to as the 
  parameter file

* bars which cross timeline sections are now given the correct width.
  Note that in order to do this, sections (as defined by appearance
  files) are no longer allowed to overlap at the end year, as they did
  previously

* switched to doing in-place updates of the existing html so that we
  don't blow out browser HTTP if-modified-since caches by
  unnecessarily changing file dates.

* color swatch files are now generated

* all timeline bars that cross into the future section are now generated

* eliminated TIMELINE.nowwidth in favor of calculating this
  dynamically to ensure correctness

* various minor bug fixes
